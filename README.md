## 📌 About the Project

**EconoMap** is a data-driven dashboard that analyzes and visualizes the income and expenditure patterns of Filipino households using the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) and supplementary data from the Labor Force Survey (LFS). This tool is designed to help **government policymakers, researchers, and economists** explore regional financial stability, income disparities, and employment trends to make more informed decisions and policy interventions.

The project aims to tackle the following real-world issues:
- Are Filipino families earning enough to meet basic needs?
- Which regions face the greatest income vs. expenditure strain?
- What’s the impact of unemployment and education on financial well-being?

The project was driven by pressing economic concerns such as:
- Rising cost of living vs. stagnant incomes
- Food insecurity in lower-income brackets
- Regional inequality in employment and wage opportunities
- Lack of visualized, comparative household financial data
